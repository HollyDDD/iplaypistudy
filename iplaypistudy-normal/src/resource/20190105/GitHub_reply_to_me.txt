I've confirmed that we are currently blocking the Baidu user agent from crawling GitHub Pages sites. We took this action in response to this user agent being responsible for an excessive amount of requests, which was causing availability issues for other GitHub customers. This is unlikely to change any time soon, so if you need the Baidu user agent to be able to crawl your site you will need to host it elsewhere.
